# Match 2 Memory Game
This is a text-based version of the class memory game. Here the player will be given an 8x8 board and will try to match pairs of 
cards by inputing coordinates to positions on the board.
# Motivation
This game was made as part of the AppAcademyOnline Ruby Curriculum. As stated on the assignment page the game has the following 
learning goals:

- Understand how classes interact in an object-oriented program
- Be able to use require_relative
- Be able to write the methods [] and []= and explain how they work
- Develop a workflow that uses pry to test small parts of your code
- Know how to initialize an Array with a default value
- Know how to use duck typing to allow different classes to interact with your program

Out of these goals, I hope that I will better understand structuring a larger program, writing and getting classes to interact with one another to create a fully-formed and functioning program. Of course, I don't expect this it to be perfect, but I do hope that my knowledge of Ruby and the logic behind the game will naturally improve by attempting this assignment.
#Tech
As stated above, I am programming this game as part of the online Ruby curriculum offered by App Academy and, therefore, only used
Ruby.
# Games Classes
The game currently consists of three files representing three classes: card, board, and memory_game. Below the function of each 
class will be explained.
## class Card
This class will create one card and initialize it with a value and the class instance "face_up" that will be controlled by the methods
"hide" and "reveal" to determine whether or not the card is currently being shown on the board or not. Depending on their values the 
method "display_card" will show/hide the card.
## class Board
## class Memory_Game
